### Definition (As per Yogeshwar Shukla sir)
> Data structure is a name given to rule-set **specifying arrangement of multible anonymous object**
in a application's memory such that **all objects are reachable via one variable name.**

Explanation :
1. allocate N anonymous objects WITHOUT N DEDICATED VARIABLE NAME
2. only one object is allowed to have name attached to it :  Named object : 1 , Unnamed Object for it : N-1
3. Objects arranged as per specific rules 
if all 3 satisfied then its datastructure
- ex. whatsapp group name
---
DS (beginner definition) :  
way of representing data -> class Book: is how book represented here not ds but arranged Books in shelf using on bookshelf object
i.e data representation is not data arrangement


### Why all such datastructures came in picture like Array,Linkedlist,Binary Tree,Red black tree?
- Because the need of specific situation
- there are categories of algorithms
    1. algorithms that works on collection or container of data
        - add data
        - remove data
        - delete data
        - traverse data
        - search data

### when to create new DS ?
- determining efficiency while doing above algorithms 
    - If we have more add,remove data operation than searching so I have to efficient ds for those operation
    - to get searching operation efficient we prefered redblack or binary tree
- Implement datastructure for specific need that above all algorithms does not solve
    - get shortest path in township in minimum path 
    - relation between two objects and using specific attribute to operate on it
